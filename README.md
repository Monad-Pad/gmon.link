## Help build gmon.link
gmon.link is a community-run project initially started by the team behind Monad Pad. If you have any suggestions, ideas, or want to help build and show your skills to the Monad ecosystem, please open an issue or a pull request üíú

View the Telegram bot's Github Repository [here](https://github.com/Monad-Pad/gmonlink-bot/).

# Setting it up locally
To setup the front-end of gmon.link locally to for example; help contribute to the platform or play around with it. You need to follow the following steps:

## 1. Setting up the Database
Head over to [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) and create a new account/project, call this project `gmonlink`.

Go to the `Table Editor` section to create the following tables:

### 1.1. Analytics (analytics)
This table is used to store the analytics for each link. It contains the following columns:
- id: int8 (primary key, is identity)
- slug: text
- type: text
- created_at: timestampz (default to `now()`)

### 1.2. Users (users)
This table is used to store the users that have created an account via the @gmonlinkbot on Telegram. It contains the following columns:
- id: int8 (primary key, is identity)
- user_id: int8
- username: text
- created_at: timestampz (default to `now()`)

### 1.3. Projects (projects)
This table is used to store the projects that users have created. It contains the following columns:
- project_id: int8 (primary key, is identity)
- user_id: int8 (foreign key to `users.id`)
- title: text
- slug: text (is unique)
- theme: text (default to `violet`)
- is_verified: boolean (default to `false`)
- avatar_url: text
- description: text
- buttons: jsonb
- created_at: timestampz (default to `now()`)

### 1.4. Links (links)
This table is used to store the links that users have created. It contains the following columns:
- link_id: int8 (primary key, is identity)
- project_id: int8 (foreign key to `projects.project_id`)
- title: text
- url: text
- order: int8
- description: text
- category: text
- icon: text
- created_at: timestampz (default to `now()`)

### 1.5. Storing Images
This is not a table, but a bucket in the `Storage` section of your Supabase project. You can find it by clicking `Storage` in the sidebar.

Let's create a new bucket, call it `gmon.link` and make it a public bucket.

Files uploaded in this bucket will be accessible by users to view the images inside it, the `Project Slug` is the file name followed by the extension.
Example: `monad-pad.png` for the Monad Pad project logo, also called `avatar_url` in the projects table.

## 2. Setting up the front-end
Now that you've setup the database, you can start setting up the front-end.

Let's start by forking the repository, click `Fork` in the top right corner. A pop-up will appear, you can leave the default options there and just click `Create fork`. After a few seconds, you should be redirected to your own copy of the repository.

Open the forked repository in your favourite IDE, we recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Cursor](https://cursor.com/).

### 2.1. Install dependencies
To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```bash
npm install
```

### 2.2. Setup environment variables
Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env.local`.

You will see the following environment variables:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=
JWT_SECRET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

All these except the `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` & `GITHUB_TOKEN` can be found in the `Project Settings` -> `API` section of your Supabase project.

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` is used to determine the environment of the application, you can set it to `development` while locally developing, and `production` when you want to deploy the application. In `/lib/utils.ts` you can see exactly what this does.

You can leave the `GITHUB_TOKEN` as it is, this is used to fetch contributors on the `Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è by` section of the landing page.

### 2.3. Change the database schema
The production version of gmon.link is using a different schema than the local version, this is because the production version is hosted by Monad Pad and we are using a different Supabase project for it.

To change the schema to public (default), you need to set the `useSchema` variable to `false` in `/lib/clients/supabase.ts`.

### 2.4. Run the application
To run the application, run the following command:
```bash
npm run dev
```

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.
